# PokerHand

Hands are composed of 5 cards with rankings are defined at: http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-hand-ranking
Poker cards are represented by 2 characters â€“ first for the value and the second for the suite.  So QH = Queen of Hearts, AS = Ace of Spades, 6D = 6 of diamonds, etc.  See tables below.
 
The program should take in two parameters representing two poker hands and return a message indicating which hand wins.
